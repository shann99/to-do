#get user input on what they want to save as a to-do
#save to-dos in a list
#if its in a list, it already has a number: 
#1. get position of the lists and return them + the actual to-do
#2. ask which to-do they want to cross off by the number
#3. save those crossed-off to-dos in another list, so when they want to see them: they're crossed off ones are all there
#make it pretty lol
#ask if user would like to add another to-do
